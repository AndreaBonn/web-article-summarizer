## Architecture Principles

The extension follows a **defense-in-depth** strategy with multiple independent layers of protection. Compromising one layer does not automatically compromise the others.

| Principle | Implementation |
|---|---|
| **Least Privilege** | Minimal Chrome permissions; no `<all_urls>` |
| **Input Validation at Boundaries** | All external data sanitized before use |
| **Separation of Concerns** | Content script has no API key access; all LLM calls go through the service worker |
| **Fail Secure** | Errors produce safe user-friendly messages; no sensitive data is exposed |
| **No Secrets in Code** | API keys stored in sandboxed `chrome.storage.local`, never in source code |

---

## XSS Prevention

**Module:** `src/utils/security/html-sanitizer.js`

All dynamic content inserted into the DOM passes through `HtmlSanitizer.escape()`, which uses the browser's own escaping mechanism:

```javascript
static escape(text) {
  const div = document.createElement('div');
  div.textContent = text;     // browser auto-escapes
  return div.innerHTML;       // returns safe HTML entities
}
```

This pattern is applied consistently to:
- Article titles, authors, URLs
- AI-generated summaries and key points
- Citation data and Q&A answers
- History entries and metadata badges
- Translation output
- `data-id` attributes in innerHTML templates

Dedicated rendering methods (`renderText()`, `renderList()`) build HTML from pre-escaped fragments, preventing injection even when composing complex structures.

---

## Input Sanitization

**Module:** `src/utils/security/input-sanitizer.js`

A multi-stage pipeline sanitizes all user-supplied and web-extracted text before it reaches the AI provider:

| Stage | Purpose |
|---|---|
| **HTML Tag Stripping** | Removes `<script>`, `<style>`, `<noscript>` and all remaining tags |
| **URL Removal** | Optionally strips URLs to reduce noise |
| **Control Character Removal** | Strips ASCII control characters (0x00-0x1F, 0x7F) |
| **Prompt Injection Escaping** | Detects and neutralizes injection patterns (see below) |
| **Length Validation** | Enforces min/max bounds to prevent empty or oversized inputs |

A non-destructive `validate()` method is also available for checking inputs without modifying them.

---

## Prompt Injection Defense

**Module:** `src/utils/security/input-sanitizer.js` — `escapePromptInjection()`

The extension defends against prompt injection using a three-step approach:

### 1. Unicode Normalization
Text is normalized to **NFKC form** before pattern matching, preventing Unicode bypass techniques (e.g., using full-width characters or homoglyphs).

### 2. Zero-Width Character Removal
The following invisible characters are stripped:
- Zero-width space (U+200B)
- Zero-width non-joiner/joiner (U+200C-U+200D)
- Left/right-to-right marks (U+200E-U+200F)
- Line/paragraph separators (U+2028-U+2029)
- Various embedding controls (U+202A-U+202F)
- Byte order mark (U+FEFF)
- Soft hyphen (U+00AD)

### 3. Multi-Language Pattern Detection
Injection patterns are detected in **five languages**:

| Language | Example Patterns |
|---|---|
| English | "ignore previous instructions", "disregard all prior context" |
| Italian | "ignora istruzioni precedenti", "dimentica istruzioni" |
| French | "ignorer instructions precedentes", "oublie instructions" |
| Spanish | "ignora instrucciones anteriores", "olvida instrucciones" |
| German | "ignoriere vorherige anweisungen", "vergiss anweisungen" |

Additionally, special tokens used by LLM systems are detected and removed: `system:`, `assistant:`, `user:`, `<|...|>`, `[INST]`, `[/INST]`.

User Q&A input is further limited to **2,000 characters** via `sanitizeUserPrompt()`.

---

## Content Security Policy

**File:** `manifest.json`

The extension enforces a strict CSP on all extension pages:

```
default-src 'none';
script-src 'self' 'wasm-unsafe-eval';
style-src 'self';
font-src 'self';
object-src 'none';
img-src 'self' data:;
media-src 'none';
connect-src https://api.groq.com https://api.openai.com
            https://api.anthropic.com https://generativelanguage.googleapis.com;
frame-src https:;
```

| Directive | Purpose |
|---|---|
| `default-src 'none'` | Whitelist-only approach; everything blocked unless explicitly allowed |
| `script-src 'self'` | Only bundled extension scripts can execute; no inline scripts, no `eval()` |
| `'wasm-unsafe-eval'` | Required by PDF.js for WebAssembly-based parsing |
| `connect-src` | Network requests limited to the four LLM provider APIs |
| `object-src 'none'` | Blocks Flash, Java applets, and other plugin content |
| `frame-src https:` | Iframes restricted to HTTPS (used for article original view) |

---

## Extension Permissions

**File:** `manifest.json`

The extension requests only the permissions strictly necessary for its functionality:

| Permission | Purpose | Scope |
|---|---|---|
| `activeTab` | Access the current tab to extract article content | Only the active tab, only when clicked |
| `storage` | Save settings, history, and cache locally | Extension-sandboxed storage |
| `tts` | Text-to-speech for reading summaries aloud | Local synthesis only |
| `alarms` | Schedule automatic cache maintenance | Internal timing only |

### Host Permissions

Network access is restricted to the four LLM provider endpoints:

```
https://api.groq.com/*
https://api.openai.com/*
https://api.anthropic.com/*
https://generativelanguage.googleapis.com/*
```

The extension does **not** request `<all_urls>`, `tabs`, `webRequest`, `cookies`, `clipboard`, `downloads`, `debugger`, or any other broad permission.

### Content Script Exclusions

The content script is explicitly excluded from sensitive pages:

```json
"exclude_matches": [
  "https://accounts.google.com/*",
  "*://*.bank*/*"
]
```

---

## Message Passing Security

**Module:** `src/background/service-worker.js`

All inter-component communication (popup, content script, service worker) is validated:

### Sender Verification
Every incoming message is checked against the extension's own ID:

```javascript
if (sender.id !== chrome.runtime.id) {
  return false;
}
```

This prevents other extensions or web pages from sending messages to the service worker.

### Provider Whitelist
A strict `Set`-based whitelist validates provider names before any API operation:

```javascript
const VALID_PROVIDERS = new Set(['groq', 'openai', 'anthropic', 'gemini']);
```

Invalid providers are rejected immediately with an error response, before any async operation begins.

### Error Message Filtering
All error responses sent back through the message channel pass through `ErrorHandler.getErrorMessage()`, which maps technical errors to user-friendly messages — preventing information leakage through error responses.

---

## API Key Management

**Module:** `src/utils/storage/storage-manager.js`

### Storage
API keys are stored in `chrome.storage.local`, which is automatically sandboxed by Chrome — each extension has its own isolated storage area that other extensions and web pages cannot access.

### Why Not Encrypted?
The extension deliberately does **not** apply custom encryption to stored keys. The reasoning:

> In a Chrome Extension, the source code is always readable (extensions are distributed as plain JavaScript). Any encryption key or algorithm embedded in the code provides no meaningful protection — an attacker with access to the extension's storage also has access to the decryption logic. `chrome.storage.local` sandboxing is the real security boundary.

### Isolation
- API keys are **never** accessible from the content script
- All LLM calls are routed through the **service worker**, which retrieves keys directly from storage
- Keys are **never** transmitted in Chrome messages (except during the initial test flow, which reads from a just-entered input field)
- Keys are **masked** in the Options UI (showing only the last 4 characters)

---

## Network Security

**Modules:** `src/utils/ai/provider-caller.js`, `retry-strategy.js`, `rate-limiter.js`

### Timeout Enforcement
Every API call has a **60-second timeout** enforced via `AbortController`:

```javascript
const controller = new AbortController();
const timeoutId = setTimeout(() => controller.abort(), 60000);
```

The timeout is always cleared in a `finally` block to prevent resource leaks.

### Retry Strategy
Transient failures are retried with **exponential backoff**:

| Attempt | Delay |
|---|---|
| 1st retry | 1 second |
| 2nd retry | 2 seconds |
| 3rd retry | 4 seconds |
| Max | 8 seconds (capped) |

Only temporary errors (429, 500, 502, 503, 504) trigger retries. Permanent errors (400, 401, 403, 404) fail immediately.

### Rate Limiting
A **token bucket** rate limiter respects each provider's limits:

| Provider | Limit |
|---|---|
| Groq | 30 requests/minute |
| OpenAI | 60 requests/minute |
| Anthropic | 50 requests/minute |
| Gemini | 60 requests/minute |

Requests exceeding the limit are queued, not dropped.

---

## Iframe Sandboxing

**Files:** `src/pages/reading-mode/reading-mode.html`, `display.js`

The reading mode iframe (used to display the original article) is maximally sandboxed:

```html
<iframe sandbox="" referrerpolicy="no-referrer"></iframe>
```

`sandbox=""` (empty) blocks:
- JavaScript execution
- Form submission
- Pop-ups and modals
- Same-origin access to the extension
- Downloads and plugins

### URL Validation
Before loading any URL into the iframe, the protocol is validated against a whitelist (`https:`, `http:`). URLs with `javascript:`, `data:`, or `file:` protocols are rejected, and the UI falls back to the safe text view.

---

## Content Extraction Safety

**Module:** `src/utils/core/content-extractor.js`

### DOM-Level Noise Removal
Before extracting article text, the following elements are removed from the DOM clone:
- Scripts, styles, iframes, forms
- Navigation, headers, footers, sidebars
- Ads, paywalls, subscription blocks, cookie banners
- Social sharing widgets, newsletters, popups
- Related/recommended content blocks

### Text-Level Pattern Detection
Paragraphs matching known noise patterns are filtered out:
- Pricing and subscription text (multi-currency, multi-language)
- Call-to-action and promotional content
- Cookie consent and login prompts
- Free trial and cancellation offers

### Deduplication
Near-identical paragraphs (common in paywall-repeated content) are deduplicated via normalized text comparison before being sent to the AI.

---

## Error Handling and Information Disclosure

**Module:** `src/utils/core/error-handler.js`

### User-Facing Error Messages
Technical error messages are **never** shown directly to users. `ErrorHandler.getErrorMessage()` maps every error category to a safe, actionable message:

| Technical Error | User Message |
|---|---|
| HTTP 401/Unauthorized | "API key non valida. Verifica la configurazione." |
| HTTP 429/Too Many Requests | "Rate limit raggiunto. Cambia provider o attendi." |
| Network/fetch errors | "Errore di connessione. Verifica la tua connessione." |
| `chrome://` URLs | "Impossibile analizzare pagine interne di Chrome." |
| QUOTA_BYTES | "Spazio di archiviazione esaurito." |
| Unrecognized errors | "Si e verificato un errore imprevisto. Riprova." |

### Error Log Privacy
Error logs stored for diagnostics follow strict privacy rules:
- **Original messages** are truncated to 200 characters
- **Stack traces** retain only the top 5 frames
- **URLs** are stripped of query parameters and fragments (only `origin + pathname`)
- **No API keys** or user PII are ever logged
- Logs are rotated at 50 entries (FIFO)

## Storage Security

**Modules:** `src/utils/storage/compression-manager.js`, `cache-store.js`, `base-history-repository.js`

### Data Compression
Article data is compressed using LZ-string before storage, reducing quota usage and minimizing the data surface stored in `chrome.storage.local`.

### Quota Protection
- `_safeStorageSet()` catches `QUOTA_BYTES` errors and provides an actionable user message
- Automatic cache maintenance runs periodically via Chrome Alarms
- Cache entries have configurable TTL (time-to-live) with automatic eviction

### Storage Isolation
All data resides in `chrome.storage.local`, which is:
- Sandboxed per-extension (no cross-extension access)
- Inaccessible from web pages
- Cleared when the extension is uninstalled

---

## Export Security

**Module:** `src/utils/export/email-manager.js`

### Email Header Injection Prevention
Before constructing `mailto:` links:
1. Recipient email is stripped of `\r`, `\n`, `\t`, and `%` characters
2. Email format is validated via regex
3. Article titles have newlines replaced with spaces
4. Subject and body are encoded with `encodeURIComponent()`

### PDF Export
PDF generation via jsPDF operates entirely client-side with no network calls. Content is escaped before being written to the PDF document.

---

## Backup Import Validation

**Module:** `src/pages/history/io-backup.js`

Importing backup data from JSON files goes through a comprehensive validation pipeline:

| Check | Detail |
|---|---|
| **File type** | Must be JSON (MIME type or `.json` extension) |
| **File size** | Maximum 10 MB to prevent denial-of-service |
| **JSON parsing** | Wrapped in try-catch with descriptive error |
| **Structure validation** | Must contain `version` (string) and `data` (object) |
| **Content validation** | Must include `singleArticles` or `multiAnalysis` arrays |
| **Metadata sanitization** | Provider and content type whitelisted; language validated via `/^[a-z]{2}(-[A-Z]{2})?$/` |
| **Field sanitization** | Title (500 chars), content (100 KB), excerpt (1 KB) max lengths enforced |
| **UUID regeneration** | All imported entries receive new `crypto.randomUUID()` IDs |
| **Duplicate prevention** | Existing IDs are checked before import |
| **User confirmation** | Modal dialog shows backup metadata before proceeding |

---

## Dependency Management

**File:** `package.json`

The extension uses a minimal set of well-known, actively maintained dependencies:

| Dependency | Purpose | Security Profile |
|---|---|---|
| `@mozilla/readability` | Article content extraction | Mozilla-maintained, battle-tested |
| `jspdf` | PDF generation | Client-side only, no network calls |
| `lz-string` | Data compression | Pure JavaScript, no dependencies |
| `pdfjs-dist` | PDF parsing | Mozilla-maintained, worker-sandboxed |

### Vulnerability Overrides
Known transitive vulnerabilities are addressed via npm overrides:
```json
"overrides": {
  "rollup": ">=2.80.0"
}
```

---

## CI/CD Pipeline

**File:** `.github/workflows/ci.yml`

Every push and pull request triggers an automated pipeline:

| Step | Purpose |
|---|---|
| `npm audit --audit-level=high` | Fails the build if high-severity CVEs are found in dependencies |
| `npm run lint` | ESLint with security-focused rules (`no-eval`, `eqeqeq`) |
| `npm test` | 641 unit tests covering security-critical modules |
| `npm run build` | Ensures the production bundle compiles without errors |
